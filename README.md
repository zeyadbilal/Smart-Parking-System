# Smart-Parking-System
The Smart Parking System uses Arduino and sensors to manage parking. It features an MQ-2 sensor for fire detection, an LDR sensor for adjusting lighting, and an IR sensor to track entry and exit. The system calculates available spaces, controls entry, and ensures safety with separate gates and automatic responses.
